      <h2 id="excel-intro">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Excel is more than a modeling tool; it is a primary mode of financial communication. In private equity and financial services, your spreadsheet speaks for you. Whether you are sharing assumptions, updating models live on a call, or preparing outputs for investment committees, clarity in Excel reflects clarity in thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        At firms like Blackstone, where precision and speed are critical, Excel is treated as a communication deliverable. Well-structured models help senior team members, partners, and investors quickly grasp key takeaways and make informed decisions. Formatting conventions, transparency in inputs, and auditability are not just technical standards; they are part of how trust is built across the firm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section shows how to make your Excel work readable, reliable, and presentation-ready, just like any other piece of high-stakes financial communication.
