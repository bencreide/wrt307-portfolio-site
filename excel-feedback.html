        “Analysts are regularly expected to revise Excel models in response to feedback from senior team members. 
        These comments might appear as in-line notes, comment balloons, or instructions in Slack. How you interpret, 
        implement, and communicate these changes reflects your professionalism and directly impacts turnaround time, 
        clarity, and trust.”

      <section id="step1">
        <h2>Step 1: Read Each Comment Carefully</h2>
        <p>Before doing anything, read the comment twice. Ask:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is it a question or a directive?</li>
          <li>What exactly is being requested?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
           VP writes: “Should we increase the exit cap to 5.5% based on the new comp set?”<br>
           This is not a direct instruction — it’s a prompt to consider and verify.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="step2">
        <h2>Step 2: Make the Requested Change in the Model</h2>
        <p>Apply the change precisely and confirm that formulas update downstream.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
           You update the exit cap from 5.0% to 5.5% in the assumptions tab and verify it flows through to the valuation.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="step3">
        <h2>Step 3: Leave a Brief Reply or Note Near the Change</h2>
        <p>Use a reply comment or nearby note to confirm what you did.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
          “Updated exit cap to 5.5% as discussed — see changes reflected in row 130.”</p>
      </section>

      <section id="step4">
        <h2>Step 4: Ask for Clarification if Needed</h2>
        <p>If you’re unsure, flag it with a note or message the reviewer.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
          “Used 5.5% based on IR team comp set — happy to revert if needed.”</p>
      </section>

      <section id="step5">
        <h2>Step 5: Mark Comments as Resolved</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click “Resolve” (in threaded comments)</li>
          <li>Or delete the comment after you’ve responded</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid leaving resolved comments visible.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="step6">
        <h2>Step 6: Summarize Updates When Sharing the File</h2>
        <p>When you send the file back, provide a bullet summary:</p>
        <pre><code>Changes made to Investor Model v3.1:
• Updated exit cap to 5.5% (Tab 2, Row 130)
• Corrected IRR calc for updated NOI
• Recolored historicals for consistency</code></pre>
