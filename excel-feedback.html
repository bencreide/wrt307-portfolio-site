        Analysts are regularly asked to revise models based on comments left by senior team members. How clearly you
        interpret and reflect those revisions can directly impact turnaround time, deal clarity, and trust in your work.
        Addressing comments cleanly keeps projects moving and avoids confusion or double work.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Read each comment carefully before taking action</li>
        <li>Make the requested change directly in the model</li>
        <li>Leave a brief note or reply comment where applicable</li>
        <li>If clarification is needed, note that too</li>
        <li>Mark resolved comments clearly</li>
        <li>Summarize updates when sharing the model</li>
      </ul>
