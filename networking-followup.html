      <h2>Overview: Following Up and Staying in Touch</h2>
      <p>
        “A follow-up message is the bridge between a good conversation and a meaningful relationship. In fast-paced industries like finance, private equity, and consulting, people are busy — but they remember those who follow up thoughtfully. A short, well-crafted message reinforces that you were engaged, professional, and respectful of their time.”

      <section id="step1">
        <h2>Step 1: Follow Up Within 24 Hours</h2>
        <p>
          Send your follow-up promptly—ideally within a day of your conversation. Acting quickly shows that you value the person’s 
          time and the insights they shared. It also ensures your interaction remains fresh in both your minds.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “Thank you for your time yesterday; I appreciated learning about your approach to structuring LBO models.”  
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step2">
        <h2>Step 2: Thank Them and Reference Something Specific</h2>
        <p>
          Open with genuine gratitude, then mention a detail or insight from your chat. This demonstrates active listening and 
          makes your message feel personalized.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “I’m grateful for your perspective on last quarter’s debt markets—it helped me refine my own analysis.”  
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step3">
        <h2>Step 3: Mention Next Steps If Relevant</h2>
        <p>
          If you agreed to an action—such as sending a document or an introduction—remind them of it. This keeps both parties aligned 
          on what comes next and maintains momentum.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “As promised, I’ve attached the summary of my cap-rate analysis for your review.”  
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step4">
        <h2>Step 4: Keep It Short and Warm</h2>
        <p>
          Aim for brevity: one to three concise paragraphs. A friendly, professional tone shows respect for their busy schedule 
          while reinforcing your interest.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “I know you’re busy, so I’ll keep this brief—just wanted to say how much I appreciated your guidance.”  
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step5">
        <h2>Step 5: Set a Reminder to Reconnect</h2>
        <p>
          A single follow-up shouldn’t be the end. Schedule yourself a note to check in again in a few weeks—perhaps sharing an 
          update or asking a brief question. Consistent follow-through builds lasting rapport.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: Calendar reminder “Check in with Jane on Q2 market trends” set for three weeks later.  
        </blockquote>
