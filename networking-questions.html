      <h2>Overview: Asking Better Questions in a Networking Conversation</h2>
      <p>
        “In networking conversations — especially in fields like finance or consulting — your ability to ask thoughtful, 
        well-framed questions helps you stand out. Good questions show preparation, curiosity, and engagement, and they often 
        lead to more valuable advice or follow-up opportunities.”

        <h2><strong>Step 1: Prepare 2–3 Focused Questions Beforehand</strong></h2>
        <p>Preparing your questions in advance demonstrates that you value the other person’s time and have done your homework. 
           It ensures the conversation stays on track and helps you gather the most useful insights.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “You’ve worked in both investment banking and private equity — what surprised you most about that transition?”
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step2">
        <h2><strong>Step 2: Avoid Yes/No or Easily Googlable Questions</strong></h2>
        <p>Yes/no questions tend to cut discussions short and reveal little about the speaker’s experience.  
           Instead, ask open-ended, specific questions that require thoughtful responses and show you did your research.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Instead of “What does your company do?”, ask “I read that your team focuses on middle-market infrastructure deals —  
          what does a typical transaction look like on your end?”
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step3">
        <h2><strong>Step 3: Add Context Before You Ask</strong></h2>
        <p>Framing your question with context shows that you’ve researched their background or the industry.  
           It helps the respondent tailor their answer to your interests and makes the question more engaging.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “I’m especially interested in firms doing office-to-residential conversions. I saw you were involved in a few UK 
          repositioning deals — what made those viable?”
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step4">
        <h2><strong>Step 4: Listen Actively and Ask Follow-Ups</strong></h2>
        <p>Active listening signals respect and keeps the conversation flowing naturally.  
           Follow up on their answers to dig deeper and clarify any points you don’t fully understand.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “That makes sense — how involved were you personally in that due diligence process?”
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="step5">
        <h2><strong>Step 5: Don’t Dominate the Conversation</strong></h2>
        <p>Balance asking questions with giving space for their insights.  
           Encouraging the other person to share keeps the discussion collaborative and informative.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: “No rush to answer everything — I’d love to hear whatever you think is most useful for someone early in the process.”
        </blockquote>
